# ETF-Strategy
Mid Frequency ETF Trading Strategy 
The goal of this project is to create a long only trading strategy combining intraday NAV values and high frequency metrics. This project was done in collaboration with Anthony Puffenbarger, Cole Stecyk, and Kelvin Wang. We gathered trade book data from the TAQ database within WRDS and iNAV series from Bloomberg.
